# my-nemo-actions

## Install Nemo Actions ##
Copy the files and folders for the wanted nemo action to your nemo actions directory. Linux Mint stores the Nemo Actions in <code>~/.local/share/nemo/actions</code> (user) and <code>/usr/share/nemo/actions</code> (system-wide).
Also make sure the shell scripts (if any) are executable. 
Your Nemo Action will appear in the context menu when you right-click. Actions on files will appear only if right-click-ed file is of supported type (e.g. mp3). If you don't see the Nemo Action, log out and back in.
